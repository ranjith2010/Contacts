/*!
 The base view controller. All view controllers should be extending from this.
 This provides the default implementation of ZPLongTaskViewProtocol.
 This also helps to isolate busy indicator, UI alerts so that they can be changed or replaced with new implementation.
 This provides basic implementation for automatic keyboard handling so that views are not
 obscured with keyboard.
